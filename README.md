# PatternLearning

This repository contains WIP notebooks which use several machine learning techniques to tackle problems in developmental biology. 

* Solve mathematical models of pattern formation in the developing embryo using Physics informed neural networks (PINNs).
* Learn key parameters of mathematical models by applying the inverse PINN method.
* Using operator search methods, including sparse regression to learn the functional forms of mathematical models that represent biological/mathematical data well.
